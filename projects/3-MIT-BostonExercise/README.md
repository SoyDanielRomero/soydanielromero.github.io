<img src='./img/boston.png'>

This is an exercise developed during MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN. 

The goal of this exercise is to pick out the number of people working in the city of Boston who earn over $100,000 and display it on the web page as shown below: 
Number of people working in Boston earning over $100,000 is xxxx.

Next, pick out the top 5 earners in Boston (total salary + overtime) and list them out in the web page as shown below:
Name     Total Earned 

Last, pick out the employees who earn over $200,000 and display it on the web as shown below;
