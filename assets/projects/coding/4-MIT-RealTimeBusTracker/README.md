## Real Time Bus Tracker üë®‚Äçüíª
<img src='./img/bostonbus.jpg'>

This is an exercise developed during MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN. 

The goal of this exercise is to fetch data from an API and use it to animate a map.

I implemented a function to update MBTA Route 1 buses geolocation in real time every 15 seconds, and I attached to them their own markers with the bus number to identify them. I added the buses' geolocation to an array and create markers with their positions. I also wrote a function to get rid of previous markers.
